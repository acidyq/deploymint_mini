## Key Files

### `api/server.js`
Express REST API with endpoints:
- `GET /api/servers` - List all configured servers with real-time status
- `POST /api/start` - Start a server process in detached mode
- `POST /api/stop` - Stop a server process (kills PID)
- `POST /api/configure` - Save server configuration (directory, command, port)

**Key Functions**:
- `checkPort()` - Uses `lsof -i :PORT -t` to detect running processes and PIDs
- `loadServers()` / `saveServers()` - JSON persistence for configuration
- Process spawning with `detached: true, stdio: 'ignore'` and `child.unref()` for true background execution

### `public/index.html`
Single-page application with vanilla JavaScript:
- Server list with real-time status updates (2-second polling)
- Start/Stop buttons for each configured server
- Configuration modal (⚙ button) for setting directory, command, and port
- Status indicators: unconfigured (gray), running (green + PID), stopped (red), unknown (yellow)
- Toast notifications for user feedback (success/error)
- No external dependencies, pure HTML/CSS/JS

### `servers.json`
Auto-generated configuration file storing server settings by URL as key.

**Example configuration**:
```json
{
  "http://localhost:3000": {
    "directory": "/Users/acydyca/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/My_Drive/windsurf_projects/PasteBeam_Downloader",
    "command": "npm start",
    "port": 3000
  }
}
```

### `package.json`
Dependencies:
- `express` - REST API server
- `cors` - CORS middleware

Scripts:
- `npm start` - Run server on port 4000

### `README.md`
User-facing documentation with setup and usage instructions.

## Technical Implementation

### Process Management
```javascript
// Start process as detached background task
const [cmd, ...args] = config.command.split(' ');
const child = spawn(cmd, args, {
    cwd: config.directory,        // Run in project directory
    detached: true,               // Detach from parent process
    stdio: 'ignore',              // Don't pipe output
    shell: true                   // Allow shell commands
});
child.unref(); // Allow parent to exit independently
```

**Why this works**:
- `detached: true` - Process runs independently of parent
- `stdio: 'ignore'` - No stdio pipes, process fully detached
- `child.unref()` - Parent can exit without waiting for child
- `shell: true` - Allows commands like "npm start" to work

### Port Detection & Status Checking
```javascript
// Check if port is in use and get PID
exec(`lsof -i :${port} -t`, (error, stdout) => {
    if (error || !stdout.trim()) {
        resolve({ running: false, pid: null });
    } else {
        resolve({ running: true, pid: stdout.trim() });
    }
});
```

**Why `lsof`**:
- Reliable way to check if port is in use
- Returns PID of process using the port
- Works across different process types (Node.js, Python, etc.)
- More reliable than tracking PIDs directly

### Process Termination
```javascript
// Kill process by PID
exec(`kill ${portCheck.pid}`, (error) => {
    if (error) {
        return res.status(500).json({ success: false, error: error.message });
    }
    res.json({ success: true });
});
```

**Why simple `kill`**:
- Graceful termination (SIGTERM)
- Works for detached processes
- No need to track PIDs in memory

## Issues Encountered and Resolved

### Issue 1: Directory Path with Extra Quotes
- **Error**: 400 Bad Request on `/api/start`, "Directory not found" toast
- **Root Cause**: Configuration saved directory path with extra single quotes:
  ```
  "'/Users/acydyca/Library/.../PasteBeam_Downloader'"
  ```
  instead of:
  ```
  "/Users/acydyca/Library/.../PasteBeam_Downloader"
  ```
- **Fix**: Manually edited `servers.json` to remove extra quotes
- **Result**: Server starts successfully, process spawns correctly
- **Lesson**: Need to sanitize input from configuration modal

### Issue 2: Magenta Converter Stuck API Port
- **Error**: `npm start` failed because port 3001 was already in use by a previous `node dist/index.js`
- **Root Cause**: Deploymint only freed the primary UI port (4003); the API worker on 3001 kept running between restarts
- **Fix**: Extended `api/server.js` to accept multiple ports per server, aggressively free each configured port before start/restart, and stop all running PIDs; added `ports` array for Magenta Converter in `servers.json`
- **Result**: Starting Magenta Converter now reliably clears both UI and API processes, preventing EADDRINUSE errors
- **Lesson**: Some workspaces launch multiple listeners, so configuration must track every port that needs to be reclaimed

### Enhancement: Action Progress Feedback
- **Motivation**: Starting or stopping servers had no visible progress indicator, making it unclear if a request succeeded or stalled
- **Change**: Added an overlay with a spinning white diamond, disabled actions while requests are in flight, and surfaced “Starting…” status badges in `public/index.html`
- **Result**: Users see immediate feedback while Deploymint works, preventing duplicate clicks during longer start cycles

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Manual Server Configuration
- Configure via modal: directory path, start command, port number
- No authentication required (minimal by design)
- Persistent storage in JSON file
- Single server per URL

### ✅ Server Lifecycle Management
- Start servers as detached background processes
- Stop servers by killing process ID via `lsof` detection
- Processes run independently of Deploymint Mini
- No need to keep Deploymint Mini running after starting a server
- Auto-frees the configured port by terminating any conflicting processes before launch

### ✅ Real-time Status Monitoring
- Auto-refresh server status every 2 seconds
- Shows running/stopped status with color indicators
- Displays process ID (PID) when running
- Port-based detection (more reliable than container names or PID tracking)

### ✅ Clean User Interface
- Minimal, responsive design
- Configuration modal for each server
- Toast notifications for all actions (success/error/info)
- Color-coded status badges:
  - **Green** = running (with PID)
  - **Red** = stopped
  - **Gray** = unconfigured
  - **Yellow** = unknown

## Testing Results

### Manual Testing Performed
1. ✅ Configure PasteBeam Downloader server (directory, command, port)
2. ✅ Start server - process spawns successfully in background
3. ✅ Status shows "running" with PID displayed
4. ✅ Server accessible at http://localhost:3000
5. ✅ Stop server - process terminates cleanly
6. ✅ Status shows "stopped"
7. ✅ Reconfigure server settings via modal
8. ✅ Restart server after reconfiguration
9. ✅ Close Deploymint Mini - server keeps running
10. ✅ Reopen Deploymint Mini - status correctly shows "running"

### Edge Cases Tested
- ✅ Invalid directory path - shows error toast
- ✅ Port already in use - shows as running with existing PID
- ✅ Process crashes - shows as stopped
- ✅ Configuration with spaces in path - works correctly after quote fix

## Architecture Benefits

### Why the Process-based Approach Works

1. **Simpler Setup**: Depend only on Node.js and the target project
2. **Fast Startup**: Spawn processes directly with no additional orchestration layer
3. **Lightweight**: Avoid image builds or virtualized environments
4. **Direct Control**: Manage the actual application process
5. **Minimal Dependencies**: Keep the toolchain small and easy to install
6. **Straightforward Debugging**: Inspect processes with native system tools
7. **Persistent**: Processes continue running after Deploymint Mini closes

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Express.js (minimal REST API)
- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no frameworks)
- **Process Management**: Node.js `child_process` module
- **Port Detection**: Unix `lsof` command
- **Data Storage**: JSON file (servers.json)
- **Total Code**: ~600 lines across all files

---

## Future Enhancements (Not Currently Implemented)

Potential improvements if needed:

### High Priority
- **Restart functionality**: Stop + start combo button
- **Log viewing**: Capture stdout/stderr to files
- **Input sanitization**: Fix quote issue in configuration modal

### Medium Priority
- **Multiple server support**: Add/remove servers via UI
- **Process health checks**: Beyond port detection (HTTP ping)
- **Auto-restart on failure**: Crash detection and recovery

### Low Priority
- **Environment variable configuration**: Per-server .env support
- **Server groups/tags**: Organization for multiple servers
- **Custom icons/colors**: Per-server customization
- **Server templates**: Pre-configured server types (Node.js, Python, etc.)
